are you tired of having to fix error in your code one by one ?<br>
no more, now all u have to do is

- open quick input
- run `Problems Fix Runner`
- select the correct suggestion for each mistake/error

no more no less ðŸ’¥

## Notes

- for severity code meaning check https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DiagnosticSeverity
- runner will stop
    - if window loses focus
    - if no selection was made
    - if command re-executed

## TODO

- hide suggestion menu if no interaction made or cancled & go to next "if anyone knows how to, plz open a ticket"
